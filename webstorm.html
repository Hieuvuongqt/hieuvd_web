    <h2>The smartest JavaScript IDE</h2>
    <p>WebStorm is an integrated development environment for JavaScript<br/>
        and related technologies. Like other JetBrains IDEs, it makes your<br/>
        development experience more enjoyable, automating routine work<br/>
        and helping you handle complex tasks with ease.</p>
    <h2>JavaScript development made easy</h2>
    <h3>Be confident in the results of your work</h3>
    <p>Write <b>more reliable and maintainable code</b>, with the IDE<br/>
        unning dozens of code inspections as you type and<br/>
        detecting potential problems. Refactor your entire<br/>
        codebase in a few clicks and don’t miss anything when<br/>
        implementing large structural changes.</p>
    <h3>Enjoy productive coding</h3>
    <p>Get straight to coding with everything you need for<br/>
        JavaScript development available out of the box. Be more<br/>
        productive and focus on more creative tasks while<br/>
        <b>WebStorm takes care of all the routine</b> work for you.</p>
    <h3>Reduce the stress of complex tasks</h3>
    <p>Afraid of messing something up with Git and losing<br/>
        important changes? Or breaking something when<br/>
        renaming a component across your entire project?<br/>
        WebStorm will <b>simplify</b> these and other <b>challenging</b><br/>
        <b>tasks</b> so you can focus on the big picture.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <h4>Specialized in JavaScript</h4>

    </p>
    <p>Looking for a tool you can trust for even the<br/>
        trickiest parts of your JavaScript development?<br/>
        We’ve been refining WebStorm for over 10 years<br/>
        to make coding a more enjoyable experience.<br/>
        Whether you work with JS, TS, React, Vue,<br/>
        Angular, Node.js, HTML, or style sheets,<br/>
        WebStorm has you covered.</p>
    <h4>The smartest editor</h4>
    <p>
        <img src="images/demo2.png" width="778" height="390" alt="Content" />
    </p>
    <p>WebStorm deeply understands your project<br/>
        structure and can assist you with every aspect of<br/>
        writing code. It will autocomplete your code,<br/>
        detect and suggest fixes for errors and<br/>
        redundancies, and help you refactor code safely.</p>
    <h4>Built-in developer tools</h4>
    <p>
        <img src="images/demo3.png" width="778" height="390" alt="Content" />
    </p>
    <p>One of the best parts of working in an IDE is that<br/>
        all of your essential tools are available in one<br/>
        place. Use WebStorm to debug and test your<br/>
        client-side and Node.js apps as well as to work<br/>
        with version control. Take advantage of the<br/>
        linters, build tools, terminal, and HTTP client,<br/>
        which are all integrated with the IDE.</p>
    <h4>Fast navigation and search</h4>
    <p>
        <img src="images/demo4.png" width="778" height="390" alt="Content" />
    </p>
    <p>Move through your code faster, regardless of<br/>
        how large your projects are. Look for files,<br>
        classes, or symbols, and review all the matches in<br/>
        one place. Jump to the definition for any<br/>
        function, method, variable, component, or class,<br/>
        and find its usages in a few clicks.</p>
    <h4>Efficient teamwork</h4>
    <p>
        <img src="images/demo5.png" width="778" height="390" alt="Content" />
    </p>
    <p>Onboard new teammates faster with all key<br/>
        functionality prepackaged. Code together in real<br/>
        time and talk to others right from the IDE. Share<br/>
        your project configuration, including code style<br/>
        settings, and work efficiently with Git and<br/>
        GitHub.</p>
    <h4>Customizable environment</h4>

    <p>Want to extend the built-in functionality? Tailor<br/>
        WebStorm’s look and feel to your liking by<br/>
        experimenting with things like themes and<br/>
        plugins. Save your custom settings and share<br/>
        them between different instances of WebStorm.</p>
